_This is it, twelve years of study, again as many training with the monks on Mount
Selaya, and six miserable months aboard the *Emissary*. I'm ready. I have to be._

The world beneath me looked nothing like the burning pits of brimstone and
radioactive slag from the holonovels of my youth. I'd gone over the database a
thousand times, of course the planet was lush. It just didn't _feel_ right.

It was one of life's cruel ironies, I supposed. For millenia, my people had stared up
at the darkness of night and wondered, "Are we alone?" We dreamt of visitors from
another world, of all shapes, sizes, and colors imaginable. Sometimes they were
friends, arriving with messages of universal peace and prosperity. Other times, they
were demons from the deepest pits of the underworld, killing and slaughtering anyone
they happened across simply because that was all they knew. But more often than not,
they were like us. Lost, alone, and just looking for someone to talk, to share a
meal, and maybe, someone to hold.

It hadn't taken long for us to find the answer. Within a decade of breaking the
light barrier, we found them. What was left of them. The Qrenim, the V'togh,
the Minesserei, the Aj, the Ritt, the U'Ur Tavfe, and dozens of other once mighty
races that had been burnt into my memory. Forty seven species reduced to a single
metal cylinder, orbiting a tomb, gloating over the corpses of billions.

It took our best linguists and engineers a year to decode the first message.

"Witness and take heed. This world has been sterilized. It is forbidden."

The second message hadn't made any sense at the time. It wasn't until we found
our fifth buoy that the encoding had been reverse engineered. It was a number.
A staggeringly huge number. Five staggeringly huge numbers.

16,232,114,217

11,919,572,233

20,547,232,238

30,208,196,129 

13,339,205,107

Forty two more would follow.

The third message took over four years to decode. At first we thought it was
encrypted in some way, Applying the same language translation matrix as the other two
messages resulted in seemingly random gibberish. You'd think it had taken a stroke of
mathematical genious or a brute force attempt by a supercomputer the size of a
skyscraper, but the reality was actually a little embarrasing. A research intern,
fresh out of school, decided to retrain the language matrix from scratch using the
third message, because she was bored. Why no one else had bothered trying it first is
a mystery, but one hour later we had the Qrenim language translated.

"The stars will pale against the Qrenim range. We reject the false gods and their
wicked lies, the silver tongue of devils hiding the dagger that will slit our
throats. We will not be denied our rightful place among the heavens. We shall fight
to the last and cast down the Spawn of the Archfield. We shall be free, or die."

Each buoy bore a similar message, the dying breaths of forty-seven languages spat out
and echoing for an eternity in the darkness. It always bothered me; why had their
executioners immortalized their own curses? Was it a token of respect, an
acknowledgement of the bravery and resolve these peoples had displayed in their dying
moments? Or was it something more sinister; A warning? A threat? What kind of message
did it send to memorialize the lines that signed the death warrants of untold
billions? *Look how many have raged against us and failed.*

The hiss of the airlock cycling broke me away from my somber thoughts. The door
shuddered open. A frail, feathered figure stood before me, exuding a delicate beauty
that reminded me of some of the dresses women back home used over a century ago. I
assumed she was female, based on the brightness of her plumage and the chirp of her
voice. She was Scesi, one of the slave races to the Demon Lords.

"My Lord humbly welcomes you to Tocreon, and wishes you a pleasant stay. My name is
Riah, I will be your guide."

"Your Lord is most gracious. My name is Sol. I am honored to be the first of my kind
to be granted an audience before the Great Lords."

"If you will please follow me, my Lord awaits your presence with great anticipation."

I followed Riah down the pathway towards the temple. I couldn't help but notice how
many species we passed by, and how deceptively free they appeared. 

When all we had were ghosts, we expected the demons to be ravenous beasts that
devoured all those they came across. It had come as a great shock when we received
the first transmission from another living being, conviniently also a Scesi, greeting
us and inviting us to send a representative to be judged before the Great Lords, 50
years hence. Gigaquads of data followed, including a historical archive containing
the collected experiences of a thousand worlds.

It must have been horrible. 

Every world had been given the same message: send a representative and be judged. The
results were always the same: submit and be allowed to leave your homeworld; abandon
the stars and wither away; or resist and perish. It was depressing how many worlds
occupied the latter category.

Yet in all the millions of reports, barely a mention of the Demons themselves. No one
who laid eyes upon them had ever returned. Sacrificed to their insatiable bloodlust,
or torn apart molecule by molecule for judgement, or perhaps simply enslaved as
payment in part for their species' chance at freedom.

Looking around, I saw no signs of whip-bearing slave drivers or explosive collars
that dominated the popular imagination. They also didn't appear to have the
zombie-like demeanor of the nerve stapled either, though to be fair I didn't exactly
have much to compare against.

"After you," chirped Riah.
